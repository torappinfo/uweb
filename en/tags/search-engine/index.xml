      <description>Any &amp;quot;.search&amp;quot; file can be opened as search engine file, each line of which has one of the following formats:
[Engine name]:[url without &#39;%s&#39; inside]
[Engine name]:[url with &#39;%s&#39; as keyword]
[Engine name]:POST:[post params with &#39;%s&#39; as keyword]:[url]
Limitations (they are here for performance reasons):
The first engine in the file must be the first type that has no &#39;%s&#39; in the engine url. Internal scheme engine urls (such as i:, d:, c:) must have &#39;%s&#39;, since &#39;%s&#39; format is more general (only type 2 is allowed, since POST makes no sense for internal schemes).</description>
